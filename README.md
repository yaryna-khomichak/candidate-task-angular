## Senior Frontend Engineer Assessment Task

### **Overview**

Create an employee management application using Angular, RxJS, and NgRx. The application should allow users to browse a list of
users, view user details, and edit user details. The goal is to demonstrate your expertise in Angular architecture,
state management, reactive programming, and writing unit tests.

### **Project Requirements**

**Application Features**

- **User List:**
  - Display a list of employees with basic information (name, email, role, and status).
    - You can use mock data or fetch data from a mock API.
  - Include a way to filter users, e.g. by name, email, or status.

- **User Details:**
  - Display detailed information about a selected user (name, email, role, status, joining date).
  - Include a way to edit the user details.

**State Management with NgRx**

- Implement global state management for users.
- Create actions, reducers, and selectors for managing user state.

**Reactive Programming with RxJS**

- Use RxJS operators to manage state, transform data streams, and handle asynchronous operations.

**Unit Testing**

- Use Jasmine and Karma to write a few unit tests.

**Styling**

- Use SCSS for basic styling.
- You may use Angular Material or any other UI library for a polished UI.

**Documentation**

- Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application.

### **Optional Features**

- **Persistent Storage:** Use local storage or session storage to persist state across page reloads.

### **Submission Instructions**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Commit your code regularly to show your progress.
3. Ensure that the application runs without errors.
4. Submit the GitHub repository link with your final submission.

### **Evaluation Criteria**

- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Application Structure:** Proper use of Angular modules, components, services, and NgRx.
- **State Management:** Effective use of NgRx for global state management.
- **Reactive Programming:** Demonstration of RxJS for handling data streams and asynchronous operations.
- **Functionality:** Implementation of all required features and optional features.
- **Testing:** Coverage and quality of tests.
- **User Experience:** Aesthetic and functional UI/UX design. Responsive UI is not necessary in this task.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.
